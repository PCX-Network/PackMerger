/**
 * Stable, third-party-facing API surface for PackMerger.
 *
 * <p>Other plugins can obtain the API instance via
 * {@code ((PackMerger) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("PackMerger")).getApi()}
 * and use it to query the current merged-pack state or trigger merges
 * programmatically, without coupling to PackMerger's internals.</p>
 *
 * <p>For event-driven integrations (e.g. reacting to a new merge), prefer the
 * Bukkit events under {@link sh.pcx.packmerger.api.events} — they carry richer
 * context and avoid polling.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Experimental in 1.1.0.</b> This API surface may change in 1.1.x
 * patch releases as we learn how consumers use it. Targeted as stable in 1.2.</p>
