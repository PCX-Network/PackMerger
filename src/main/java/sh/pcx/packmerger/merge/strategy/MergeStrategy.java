 * (higher priority wins). Strategies exist to preserve data that would otherwise be
 * silently lost — most importantly, array-valued keys like {@code overrides} in item
 * models or {@code sources} in atlases, which {@link sh.pcx.packmerger.merge.JsonMerger#deepMergeObjects}
 * alone cannot combine safely.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations are expected to be stateless and thread-safe; a single instance
 * of each strategy is registered with {@link sh.pcx.packmerger.merge.PackMergeEngine}
 * at construction time.</p>
