A Paper plugin that merges multiple Minecraft resource packs into a single pack, uploads it to a configurable hosting provider, and automatically distributes it to players on join. Designed for servers and networks that need to combine packs from different sources into one seamless download.

## Features

- **Priority-based merging** — control which pack's files take precedence when packs overlap
- **Format-aware JSON merging** — dedicated strategies per Minecraft JSON format (models, blockstates, atlases, items, equipment, sounds, font, language, `pack.mcmeta`) so array data from multiple packs is preserved instead of silently overwritten
- **Merge provenance + `/pm inspect`** — for every output file, record which pack won and every contributor. Surface via `/pm inspect` (summary, per-pack detail, collisions, exportable report) and the plugin API
- **Validation rollback** — if a new merge trips validation errors, keep the previous pack live instead of shipping broken output to players
- **`pack_format` guardrail** — warn or error when the merged pack targets a Minecraft version different from the running server's
- **Orphan asset detection** — surface unreferenced textures and sounds so you can trim bloated merged packs
- **CustomModelData collision warnings** — logs a warning when two packs both claim the same `custom_model_data` predicate so operators get a diagnostic trail instead of a silent drop
- **In-game priority reordering** — `/pm priority up|down|top|bottom|set <pack>` edits `config.yml` and re-merges live
- **Profiles / presets** — swap whole pack compositions atomically for seasonal events or A/B tests via `/pm profile switch <name>`
- **Remote pack sources** — declare HTTPS URLs in config; PackMerger downloads and caches into `packs/.remote-cache/`, honors ETag / Last-Modified, supports bearer + basic auth with env-var substitution
- **Multiple upload providers** — self-hosted HTTP, Polymath, or any S3-compatible object store (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2) with content-addressed keys, retention, and optional presigned URLs
- **Hot reload** — watches the packs folder for changes and auto-merges with configurable debounce
- **Player cache tracking** — remembers which pack version each player has downloaded to skip redundant re-sends on rejoin
- **Per-server packs** — supports multi-server networks where each backend needs a different pack composition
- **Pack validation** — checks JSON syntax, pack.mcmeta structure, and missing texture/model references after every merge
- **Custom overrides** — drop a `pack.mcmeta` or `pack.png` in the packs folder to override the merged pack's metadata and icon
- **Concurrent download limiting** — built-in rate limiter for the self-host HTTP server
- **Plugin API + Bukkit events** — `PackMergedEvent`, `PackUploadedEvent`, `PackValidationFailedEvent`, etc. so other plugins can react without log-scraping
- **Brigadier commands** — full tab completion via Paper's command API
- **Lean jar + runtime dep loader** — the shipped jar is ~360 KB; MinIO and its S3-SDK transitive closure are downloaded from Maven Central on first enable into `plugins/PackMerger/libraries/` and verified against SHA-256. Cached across restarts.
- **Update check** — polls `versions.json` in the repo on enable and surfaces new releases in the console and to admins on join. Advisory only; the plugin never auto-downloads.

## Requirements

- **Paper 1.21+** (built against Paper API 1.21.4) or **Folia** 1.21+
- **Java 21** or newer
- `folia-supported: true` in plugin.yml — every scheduler call routes through Paper/Folia's region-aware APIs so the plugin runs without `UnsupportedOperationException`s on Folia

## Installation

1. Build the plugin (see [Building](#building)) or download the release jar
2. Place `PackMerger-1.1.0.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder
3. Start the server — the plugin generates `config.yml` and creates the `packs/`, `output/`, and `cache/` directories under `plugins/PackMerger/`
4. Place your resource pack `.zip` files or unzipped pack folders into `plugins/PackMerger/packs/`
5. Edit `plugins/PackMerger/config.yml` to configure priority order, upload provider, and distribution settings
6. Run `/packmerger reload` or restart the server

## Building

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The shaded jar (with all dependencies bundled) is output to:

```
build/libs/PackMerger-1.1.0.jar
```

Requires Java 21 to compile.

## Configuration

The plugin generates a fully commented `config.yml` on first run. Below is a walkthrough of each section.

### Server Name

```yaml
server-name: ""
```

Identifies this server for per-server pack configs. If empty, auto-detects from `server.properties`. Only relevant for multi-server networks.

### Priority

```yaml
priority:
  - "main-pack.zip"
  - "ui-overhaul.zip"
  - "custom-models.zip"
```

Controls merge order. The first entry has the **highest priority** — its files win when two packs contain the same non-mergeable file (e.g. textures). Packs found on disk but not listed here are automatically merged at the lowest priority, sorted alphabetically by filename. Use numeric prefixes (e.g. `01_pack.zip`, `02_pack.zip`) to control their order without needing to list them in the config.

### Per-Server Packs

```yaml
server-packs:
  lobby:
    additional:
      - "lobby-textures.zip"
    exclude: []
  survival:
    additional:
      - "survival-textures.zip"
    exclude:
      - "ui-pack.zip"
```

Allows each server to include extra packs or exclude packs from the global list. Matched by the `server-name` value (case-insensitive).

### Merge Settings

```yaml
merge:
  auto-merge-on-startup: true    # Merge automatically when the plugin enables
  optimization:
    strip-junk-files: true       # Remove .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, __MACOSX, .git, etc.
    compression-level: 6         # ZIP compression (0-9, default 6)
    size-warning-mb: 100         # Warn if output exceeds this size (0 = disabled)
  hot-reload:
    enabled: true                # Watch packs/ folder for changes
    debounce-seconds: 5          # Wait this long after last change before merging
```

### Upload Provider

```yaml
upload:
  auto-upload: true              # Upload after every merge
  provider: "self-host"          # "self-host" or "polymath"
```

#### Self-Host (Default)

```yaml
upload:
  provider: "self-host"
  self-host:
    port: 8080
    public-url: ""     # Auto-detects from server.properties; set explicitly if behind NAT/proxy
    rate-limit: 50     # Max concurrent downloads (0 = unlimited)
```

The self-host provider starts a built-in HTTP server. Players download from `http://<your-ip>:<port>/pack`. Make sure the port is open in your firewall.

#### Polymath (Self-Hosted)

[Polymath](https://github.com/oraxen/polymath) is a lightweight Python web server originally created by the Oraxen/Nexo project for hosting Minecraft resource packs. You must self-host your own Polymath instance — the public Oraxen instance (`atlas.oraxen.com`) has been shut down.

```yaml
upload:
  provider: "polymath"
  polymath:
    server: "https://your-polymath-host:5000"
    secret: "your-custom-secret"
    id: "my-server"
```

To self-host Polymath, you need Python installed. See the [Polymath GitHub repo](https://github.com/oraxen/polymath) for setup instructions.

### Distribution

```yaml
distribution:
  enabled: true                    # Send pack to players on join
  required: false                  # Kick players who decline (true/false)
  prompt-message: ""               # Custom MiniMessage prompt (empty = Minecraft default)
  use-add-resource-pack: false     # true = add alongside existing packs; false = replace
  join-delay-ticks: 20             # Delay before sending (20 ticks = 1 second)
  cache:
    enabled: true                  # Skip re-sending to players who already have current pack
  on-new-pack:
    action: "notify"               # "none", "notify", or "resend"
    notify-message: "<yellow>[PackMerger]</yellow> <gray>A new resource pack is available. Rejoin or use F3+T to reload.</gray>"
```

### Debug

```yaml
debug: false
```

Enables verbose logging for troubleshooting. Logs every file merge, pack send, validation check, and file watcher event.

| `/pm validate` | Run validation on the current merged pack (JSON, missing textures/models, orphan assets, pack_format drift) |
| `/pm status` | Server name, provider, last merge time, pack URL, SHA-1, file size, discovered packs |
| `/pm apply [player]` | Force-send the current pack to all online players, or just one (supports `@a` selectors) |
| `/pm inspect` | Summary of the last merge: pack order, per-pack file counts, collision count |
| `/pm inspect <pack>` | What this pack won + files it contributed to but lost on |
| `/pm inspect collisions` | List every output path touched by 2+ packs |

| `packmerger.notify` | true (all players) | Receive chat notifications when a new pack is available |

## How It Works

### Merge → Upload → Distribute Pipeline

1. **Discover** — scans `plugins/PackMerger/packs/` for `.zip` files and directories containing `pack.mcmeta` or `assets/`
2. **Order** — builds a merge order based on the priority config, per-server includes/excludes, and any unlisted packs
3. **Merge** — iterates packs from lowest to highest priority, collecting files into memory:
   - **Non-JSON files** (textures, sounds, shaders, etc.) use last-write-wins — higher priority overwrites lower
   - **Model and blockstate JSON** (`assets/<ns>/models/`, `assets/<ns>/blockstates/`) are deep merged — non-conflicting keys from both packs are preserved; item-model `overrides` arrays concat-dedup by predicate so CustomModelData from multiple packs survives
   - **sounds.json** (`assets/<ns>/sounds.json`) sound arrays are concatenated so sounds from all packs coexist
   - **Language files** (`assets/<ns>/lang/*.json`) key-union so translations from multiple packs compose; higher priority wins on the same key
   - **pack.mcmeta** preserves both `overlays.entries[]` and `filter.block[]` from every pack — deduped by `directory` and by `namespace|path` respectively
4. **Override** — if `pack.mcmeta` or `pack.png` exists directly in the packs folder (not inside a pack), it replaces whatever the merge produced
5. **Validate** — the merged zip is checked for pack.mcmeta structure, JSON syntax errors, and missing texture/model references
6. **Upload** — the merged zip is sent to the configured provider (Polymath or self-host)
7. **Distribute** — if the pack's SHA-1 hash changed, online players are handled according to the `on-new-pack` action

### Priority Order & Conflict Resolution

Packs are listed highest-priority first in the config. When two packs contain the same file path:

- **Non-JSON files**: the higher-priority pack's version is used
- **Mergeable JSON** (models, blockstates, items, equipment, atlases, font): keys are deep-merged recursively — conflicting keys use the higher-priority value, non-conflicting keys from both are preserved
- **Array-valued JSON fields** (`overrides`, `sources`, `providers`, `multipart`, `overlays.entries`, `filter.block`): concatenated across packs and deduped by a format-specific identity key (e.g. predicate, namespace/path, directory) so additions from every pack survive; higher priority wins on identity collision
- **sounds.json**: sound arrays for the same event are concatenated (higher-priority sounds listed first)
- **Language files** (`lang/*.json`): flat key-union — translations from all packs coexist, high priority wins on the same translation key
- **CustomModelData collisions**: when two packs claim the same `custom_model_data` predicate, the lower-priority entry is dropped by the predicate dedup and a warning is logged with the file path and the offending predicate so operators can spot "my knife turned into a pistol"-style conflicts at merge time

### Remote Pack Sources (1.1.0+)

Declare packs in config that come from an HTTP(S) URL and PackMerger will
download them into `packs/.remote-cache/<alias>.zip` before merging. Reference
them in `priority:` by alias (no `.zip`). Supports ETag / Last-Modified caching,
bearer + basic auth, and `${ENV_VAR}` substitution in URL and token fields.

```yaml
remote-packs:
  quality-armory:
    url: "https://github.com/user/repo/releases/latest/download/pack.zip"
    refresh: "on-startup"     # "on-startup" | "on-reload" | "manual"
    auth:
      type: "bearer"
      token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

Use `/pm fetch` or `/pm fetch <alias>` to force a re-download outside the
configured refresh policy. If a fetch fails but a cached copy exists,
PackMerger uses the cache and logs a warning — transient network failures
don't take your pack offline.

### Profiles / Presets (1.1.0+)

Flip between whole pack compositions atomically — useful for seasonal events
or A/B testing. When `active-profile` is set, its `priority` and
`server-packs` sections shadow the root-level keys. Absent = backwards-
compatible with pre-1.1.0 configs.

```yaml
active-profile: "default"
profiles:
  default:
    priority:
      - "main-pack.zip"
  halloween:
    priority:
      - "halloween-overlay.zip"
      - "main-pack.zip"
```

Switch with `/pm profile switch halloween` — PackMerger updates `active-profile`
in config, reloads, and re-merges immediately.

### S3-Compatible Upload (1.1.0+)

Set `upload.provider: "s3"` to push merged packs to any S3-compatible object
store — AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Backblaze B2. One config works for all three;
only the endpoint changes.

```yaml
upload:
  provider: "s3"
  s3:
    endpoint: "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
    region: "auto"           # R2 accepts "auto"; AWS wants the canonical name
    bucket: "my-packs"
    access-key: "${S3_ACCESS_KEY}"
    secret-key: "${S3_SECRET_KEY}"
    public-url-base: "https://packs.example.com"    # CDN in front of the bucket
    key-strategy: "content-addressed"                # <sha1>.zip, clients cache cleanly
    retention:
      keep-latest: 5                                  # old keys pruned after each upload
```

Private buckets: set `acl: "private"` and the provider returns a short-lived
presigned URL instead. The JAR ships MinIO's SDK shaded and relocated, so it
coexists with other plugins that bundle OkHttp or Jackson.

### Plugin API (1.1.0+, experimental)

Other plugins can integrate with PackMerger via the stable API surface and
Bukkit events. See `docs/api-example.java` for a copy-paste starting point.

```java
PackMerger pm = (PackMerger) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("PackMerger");
PackMergerApi api = pm.getApi();

String url = api.getCurrentPackUrl();
MergeProvenance prov = api.getLastMergeProvenance();
api.triggerMerge();
```

Available events (in `sh.pcx.packmerger.api.events`):
`PackMergeStartedEvent`, `PackMergedEvent`, `PackUploadedEvent`,
`PackUploadFailedEvent`, `PackValidationFailedEvent`,
`PackSentToPlayerEvent`.

API is marked `@Experimental` during 1.1.x — breaking changes are possible
between 1.1.0 and 1.2 as we learn from real integrations.

### Per-Server Packs

On a multi-server network, each backend server can have its own merged pack by defining `server-packs` entries in the config. Each server's `additional` packs are merged at lowest priority (below the global list), and `exclude` packs are skipped entirely. The output file is named `<server-name>-merged-pack.zip` to avoid conflicts.

### Hot Reload

When enabled, a background thread watches the `packs/` folder for file system events (create, modify, delete). To avoid excessive re-merges during bulk operations, events are **debounced** — the merge only triggers after no new events have arrived for the configured debounce period (default: 5 seconds).

### Player Cache Tracking

After a player successfully loads a resource pack, the plugin records the pack's SHA-1 hash against their UUID in `plugins/PackMerger/cache/player-cache.json`. On subsequent joins, if the player's cached hash matches the current pack hash, the download is skipped entirely. The cache is saved to disk every 5 minutes and on plugin disable.

## Troubleshooting

### Merged pack not sending to players

- Check that `distribution.enabled` is `true` in config
- Verify a merge has completed: run `/pm status` and check that Pack URL is not "N/A"
- Check the console for upload errors — if the upload failed, no URL is available to send
- Ensure `upload.auto-upload` is `true`

### Self-host port already in use

- Another process is using the configured port (default 8080)
- Change `upload.self-host.port` to an unused port
- Check with `netstat -tlnp | grep 8080` (Linux) or `netstat -an | findstr 8080` (Windows) to find the conflicting process

### Pack validation warnings

- **"Invalid JSON"** — a JSON file has syntax errors. Open it in a JSON validator to find the issue
- **"Missing texture"** — a model references a texture path that doesn't exist in the merged pack. The texture may be in a pack that was excluded or not added
- **"Missing model"** — a blockstate references a model that doesn't exist. Same cause as missing textures
- Validation warnings don't prevent the pack from being sent — they indicate potential visual issues in-game

### Players still see the old pack after a merge — was there a rollback?

Since 1.1.0, PackMerger writes new merges to `<output>.new.zip` first and
only promotes to the real output file if validation passes. If the new merge
produces validation errors and `validation.rollback-on-errors: true` (the
default), the previous pack stays live and `PackValidationFailedEvent` fires
with `rolledBack=true`.

- Check the console for `[VALIDATION]` + `rolled back` entries
- Fix the validation errors in the offending pack and `/pm reload`
- To ship despite errors (not recommended), set `validation.rollback-on-errors: false`
- First-run case: if no previous pack exists yet, the broken pack ships anyway
  with a loud error so the initial merge isn't a permanent stall

### Orphan asset warnings are too noisy for my pack set

Orphan detection (1.1.0+) scans the merged output for textures/sounds that no
JSON references. It can false-positive on packs that use regex (`filter`) atlas
sources, which PackMerger doesn't expand.

- Disable per-install: `validation.detect-orphans: false`
- Reduce the listed entries: `validation.orphan-report-limit: 5`
- Run `/pm inspect export` to see the full list in
  `output/last-merge-report.txt` if you want to audit and trim manually

### `pack_format` mismatch warning on every merge

The 1.1.0 validator compares the merged pack's `pack_format` to the running
MC version. If you're stacking packs targeting a mix of versions, the output's
value is whatever the highest-priority `pack.mcmeta` says.

- Update the pack declaring the old format, or
- Add a `supported_formats` range to its `pack.mcmeta` that includes your server's expected format, or
- Set `validation.pack-format-check: "off"` to disable the check entirely

### "CustomModelData collision" warning in the console

- This warning is emitted when two packs both define an `overrides` entry with the same `predicate` (e.g. both claim `custom_model_data: 1000001` on `minecraft:iron_sword`)
- The higher-priority pack's entry wins; the lower-priority entry is dropped
- The warning lists the file path and the offending predicate so you can reassign one side's CustomModelData to a different number to avoid the conflict
- This is informational — the pack still ships successfully. The warning exists so you aren't surprised at runtime when one pack's custom model silently replaces another

### Hot reload not detecting changes

- Check that `merge.hot-reload.enabled` is `true`
- The file watcher only monitors the top-level `packs/` directory — changes inside subdirectories of an unzipped pack may not be detected
- For unzipped packs, try re-saving the pack's root directory or touching a file in the `packs/` folder
- Check the console for "File watcher key invalidated" — this means the packs directory was deleted or moved while the watcher was running

### Players re-downloading the pack every join (cache issue)

- Ensure `distribution.cache.enabled` is `true`
- The cache only updates after the client reports `SUCCESSFULLY_LOADED` — if the client reports a different status, no cache entry is saved
- If using `use-add-resource-pack: true`, Minecraft may handle caching differently than the replace mode
- Delete `plugins/PackMerger/cache/player-cache.json` to reset the cache if it becomes corrupted
- Enable `debug: true` to see detailed pack send/skip logs per player

### Pack too large / download timeouts

- Check the output file size with `/pm status`
- Increase `merge.optimization.compression-level` (up to 9) for smaller files
- Remove unnecessary packs or textures from the packs folder
- For very large packs (200+ MB), consider using a CDN or Polymath for faster downloads
